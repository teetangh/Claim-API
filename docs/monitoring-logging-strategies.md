# Monitoring, Logging and Alerting Strategies

This document details the monitoring, logging, and alerting strategies implemented in the Claim API.

## Logging Strategy

### Log Types and Categories

The Claim API generates several types of logs:

1. **Application Logs**: General application events
   - INFO: Normal operation events
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
   - WARN: Non-critical issues that should be reviewed
   - ERROR: Critical issues that require attention

2. **Request Logs**: HTTP request information
   - Request method, path, status code
   - Response time
   - IP address
   - User information (when authenticated)

3. **Database Logs**: Database operation performance
   - Query execution time
   - Query types
   - Table access patterns

4. **Error Logs**: Detailed information about errors
   - Stack traces
   - Error contexts
   - User actions that led to errors

### Log Storage Options

#### 1. Local File System

**Implementation**: 
- Winston configured to write logs to files in the 'logs' directory
- Rotation based on file size and date

**Pros**:
- Simple setup
- No additional infrastructure
- Good for development and small deployments

**Cons**:
- Limited scalability
- No built-in search capabilities
- Requires manual log rotation and cleanup
- Not suitable for distributed systems

#### 2. Centralized Logging System (ELK Stack)

**Implementation**:
- Elasticsearch: Stores and indexes logs
- Logstash: Processes and transforms logs
- Kibana: Visualizes and searches logs

**Pros**:
- Powerful search capabilities
- Real-time visualization
- Scalable for high volume
- Centralized storage for distributed systems
- Custom dashboards and alerts

**Cons**:
- Requires additional infrastructure
- Higher complexity
- Needs maintenance and tuning

#### 3. Cloud-Based Logging Services

**Options**:
- AWS CloudWatch Logs
- Google Cloud Logging
- Azure Monitor Logs

**Pros**:
- Managed service (no infrastructure)
- Integrated with cloud environments
- Automatic scaling
- Built-in retention policies

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Potentially higher costs at scale
- Limited customization

#### 4. Containerized Logging Solution

**Implementation**:
- Fluentd/Fluent Bit to collect logs
- Forwarding to storage backends

**Pros**:
- Works well with containerized applications
- Lightweight and efficient
- Flexible output options

**Cons**:
- Additional configuration
- Requires a storage backend

### Recommended Log Storage Strategy

For the Claim API:

1. **Development/Testing**: Local file storage using Winston (current implementation)
2. **Production (Small-Medium Scale)**: ELK Stack with log retention policies
3. **Production (Large Scale)**: Cloud-native logging service or distributed ELK cluster

## Monitoring Strategy

The monitoring strategy uses Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics:

### Key Metrics

1. **System Metrics**:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network traffic

2. **Application Metrics**:
   - Request count
   - Request duration
   - Error rates
   - Active connections

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - Claim processing rate
   - Claim status distribution
   - Average processing time
   - Claim validation failures

4. **Database Metrics**:
   - Query duration
   - Connection pool usage
   - Transaction rates
   - Table access patterns

### Monitoring Implementation

1. **Metric Collection**: 
   - Prometheus client integrated into application
   - Custom metrics for claim processing
   - Default metrics for Node.js runtime
   - Database performance metrics

2. **Metric Storage**:
   - Prometheus time-series database
   - Retention policies based on business needs
   - Aggregation for long-term trends

3. **Visualization**:
   - Grafana dashboards
   - System overview dashboard
   - Application performance dashboard
   - Business metrics dashboard
   - Database performance dashboard

## Alerting Strategy

Alerts are configured to notify when system or application issues occur:

### Alert Categories

1. **Availability Alerts**:
   - Service down
   - Database connection failures
   - High error rates

2. **Performance Alerts**:
   - Slow response times
   - High CPU/memory usage
   - Slow database queries

3. **Business Alerts**:
   - High claim rejection rate
   - Processing backlog
   - Unusual claim patterns

### Alert Channels

Alerts can be delivered through multiple channels:

1. Email notifications
2. Slack/Teams messages
3. SMS for critical issues
4. PagerDuty or similar service for on-call rotation

### Alert Thresholds

Example alert thresholds:

1. Critical: Service down or error rate > 10%
2. Warning: Response time > 500ms or CPU > 80%
3. Info: Unusual traffic patterns or business metric changes

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses:

1. **Winston**: For structured logging with multiple transports
2. **Morgan**: For HTTP request logging
3. **Prometheus Client**: For metric collection and exposure
4. **Grafana**: For metric visualization and dashboards

In production, consider:

1. Setting up proper retention policies
2. Implementing log aggregation
3. Creating custom Grafana dashboards
4. Configuring Prometheus alerting rules
